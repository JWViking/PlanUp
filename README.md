# PlanUp

## Description
This is a planner application. The time displays at the top. The current hour in the planner shows as green. Passed time blocks show as gray. Future time blocks show as green. The user can type an event into a time block, click save, and the even is placed into local storage. When the window is loaded again, the events will still be there and the user can add more events, or see what time block they are currently in for the day.
